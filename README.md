## Key Features

* Given any list of coordinates and its type (Wall || Path) it will find a route from the Start to End
* Shows the nodes the program visits on the way to the end node (indicated by the blue squares)
* Shows the route from start to end (indicated by the green squares)
* Follows SOLID principles
* Uses many data structures such as 2D arrays, linked lists, queues and stacks
* Uses adjacency lists for graph representation so the program can perform DFS
* Fetches the maze grid and the solve from the backend on request
